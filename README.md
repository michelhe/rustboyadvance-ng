# Project Structure
* `core/` - Main emulator crate that ties everything together 
* `arm7tdmi/` - Emulation of the Arm7tdmi processor.
* `platform/` - Constains executables & application built with `rustboyadvance-core`
    * `platform/rustbodyadvance-wasm` - Web emulator powered by WebAssembly
    * `platform/rustbodyadvance-sdl2` - Desktop application built with sdl2
    * `platform/rustbodyadvance-minifb` - Desktop application built with minifb, *not maintained*.
    * `platform/rustbodyadvance-jni` - Java JNI binidngs for the emulator.
    * `platform/android` - A PoC Android application.

## Emulation Todo:
* CGB audio (4 wave generator channels)

# Build and usage (Desktop Application)

To get started, you need to get a [stable rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs) of version Rust 1.51 or later,

## Linux build dependencies
Install SDL2 dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev
```

## Windows build dependencies
SDL2 runtime binaries are included in this repository, no extra setup needed.

## macOS

Install SDL2 dependencies
```bash
brew install SDL2 SDL2_image
export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/homebrew/lib"
```

## Build & Usage
You need to obtain a gba bios binary.
An [open source GBA bios](https://github.com/Nebuleon/ReGBA/blob/master/bios/gba_bios.bin) is also available and supported.


Place the bios file in the repository root and name it `gba_bios.bin` (or alternatively use the `-b` command line option)


Build and run in release mode (performance is terrible in the `dev` profile)
```bash
$ cargo run --release -- path/to/rom
```


You can also drag&drop rom files or any zip files containing `.gba` files inside into the emulator window and a new rom will be loaded.

## Key bindings

> Currently the key bindings are not configureable.

GBA key bindings:

| Keyboard  	| GBA      	|
|-----------	|----------	|
| Up        	| Up       	|
| Down      	| Down     	|
| Left      	| Right    	|
| Right     	| Right    	|
| Z         	| B Button 	|
| X         	| A Button 	|
| Return    	| Start    	|
| Backspace 	| Select   	|
| A         	| L        	|
| S         	| R        	|

Special key bindings
| Key          	| Function          	|
|--------------	|--------------------	|
| Space (hold) 	| Disable 60fps cap  	|
| F1		| Custom debugger (requires --features debugger) |
| F2		| Spawn gdbserver (experimetnal, requires --features gdb) |
| F5           	| Save snapshot file 	|
| F9           	| Load snapshot file 	|


# Android Application

The android project is placed inside `platform/android`.
To build it, open it with Android Studio.

You also need to set up rust to build android targets with NDK.
